# NewRecipes
Simple app to help you find new recipes.
This app uses Edamam Recipe Search API to get recipes.

To be fair, this app was mostly created to showcase my code, but i do like to cook so at least I'll use it sometimes ... if I ever finish it.

It's not really polished or even finished, but I'm working on it. Some stuff is also more complicated than needs to be.

Also I mostly work with Expo, this has been my first app without it in couple of years.

## Instructions
1) Signup for an API on https://www.edamam.com/
2) Create apiConfog.json file based on apiConfig.template.json
3) Fill in app id and app key
